HTML - *H*yper *T*ext *M*arkup *L*anguage

## WHERE TO WRITE ?

## HTML Tags and Attributes

Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets (<>)

eg: ![1](1.jpg)

here title tag is opened and closed and text to be printed is written between them.

Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

eg : ![2](atrribute.jpg)

here the img tag has attributes like height

so we can understand 

*TAGS* ==> _SKELATON/BODY_
*ATTRBUTES* ==> _FEATURE/CHARACTERISTICS_


## Some rules to keep in mind

1. A tag is opened < tag_name > like this and closed using a forwardslash symobl (*/*) like < /tag_name >.
2. A tag opened must be closed unless not required . eg: we saw that title tag must be closed but img tag doesn't require a closing tag.
3. Wrap and indent the tags properly. The tag that open first closes last. Follwing is an example of a mistake.

:exclamation: In this HTML tag cannot close before head tag closes as HTML tag opens before haed tag

## Basic HTML Structure

A basic HTML file looks like this
![4](struct.jpg)

Line 1: All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
Line 2 AND 10: Opening and Closing HTML tag respectively (marking start and end of html doc)
Line 3 AND 6:  Opening and Closing head tag respectively (marking start and end of head of file , defining title)
Line 4: Defining title tag , which contains name of the webpage
Line 7 AND 9:  Opening and Closing body tag respectively (marking start and end of the body of web page)
Line 8: We can add more tags and ther information to be discplayed.

## Some Important Tags 

1. To set text in *boldface* we use bold tag : < b > This is bold text < /b >
2. To set text in _italicface_ we use italic tag : < i > This is italic text < /i >
3. To write a paragraph we use paragraph tag : < p > write your para < /p >

5. To aligh the text to the center of the page horizontally : < center > center aligned text < /center >
6. To insert a line break < br > tag is used , it inserts a horizontal line
7. To insert images , < img > tag is used along with attributes discussed further
8. To insert links we use < a > .... < /a> tag , the attributes used are shared ahead.
